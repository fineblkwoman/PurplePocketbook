There are a number of ways the abuser could have access to your email account: \n \nIf you share an email account with the abuser, he will be able to read any of the emails in your account.  \n \nIf you use a Web-based email program like Gmail or Yahoo, your email account may be visible to someone who visits those websites on your computer unless you properly log out.  Just closing your browser is not enough - you must first log out of your account to make sure that when the abuser goes to the email programs website, your personal account information won’t be on the screen.  \n \nIf you use of one these Web-based email programs, the abuser may be able to access your email account if he knows your email address and password.  Note: some people's computers save their email address and password for them.  If your computer has your email address and password saved, anyone with access to your computer can read your email.  \n \nIf you use a computer-based email program like Outlook, Outlook Express, Eudora or Apple Mail, anybody who has access to your computer can read your email.  \n \nIf the abuser knows your email address, remember to not open any email attachments sent from the abuser or to reply to an email sent by the abuser using your new email account, as these actions may let the abuser install spyware on your computer and track your email messages.  \n \nMost computers now have a function called AUTOCOMPLETE, which stores information you've typed on your computer in the past.  For example, if AutoComplete is turned on, when you go to type something into a search engine such as Google, a pop-up box will appear and list the things you've searched for in the past.  (You may also see this pop-up box when entering your credit card information or your address into an online form.)  If you have AutoComplete turned on, the abuser may be able to access your email account even if you haven't told him your email address or password.  \n \nIf you're not sure whether the abuser has access to your email account, for your safety it's best to act like he does, and avoid sending emails you wouldn't want him to see.", @"DVTechDetail2");

Pick a password that does not contain obvious information (such as your name, birthday, social security number, pet's name, etc.), which the abuser could guess.  It may also be a good idea to change your password regularly.  If you are not sure how to change the password on your email account, you can likely find that information by going to HELP or question.  \n \nDo not write your password down.  Make sure you change your computer settings so that it does not save your username (email address) and password.  Your computer may ask you if you want to save your username and password after you enter it.  Make sure to click NO.  \n \nWhen you are finished using your email, always log out or sign out.  If you do not hit LOG OUT or SIGN OUT your email account may still be open due to a feature called AutoComplete, even if you close the window.  \n \nIf you do decide to give the abuser your email address, remember to not open any email attachments sent from the abuser or to reply to an email sent by the abuser using your new email account, as these actions may let the abuser install spyware on your computer and track your email messages.", @"DVTechDetail3");

Therefore, to send and receive emails that might anger the abuser if he saw them, you may want to set up an alternate email account that the abuser doesn't know about.  There are a number of free, Web-based e-mail services that you can use.  When signing up for a new email account, do not use any of your real identifying information if you wish to remain private and anonymous. \n \nKeep in mind that the abuser may still be able to read your email if you create a new account if you do not log out properly or if you choose a password that he can guess or find.  The safest way to use a new email address is from a computer that the abuser does not have any access to.  \n \n \nNote: If you do decide to give the abuser your email address, remember to not open any email attachments sent from the abuser or to reply to an email sent by the abuser using your new email account, as these actions may let the abuser install spyware on your computer and track your email messages.", @"DVTechDetail4");

Consider the articles you post to your profile, the pictures you put in an online album, or any status updates that indicate where you are at the moment (such as CHECKING IN at a restaurant) or where you are headed (such as a vacation destination).  These types of posts can reveal a lot about you: your interests, your whereabouts, and your future plans, which can lead to someone finding you. \n \nLog out of your account by clicking “log out” after each session on your social media page.

Despite privacy settings, computer hackers and computer spyware can potentially access your information.  \n \nA good test to find out how searchable you are on the Internet is to search your own name (using a search engine such as Google) and see what comes up.  If you have a common name, try modifying your search by including some basic information like your city or high school.

Additionally, now that you are no longer friends, their activities will not show up on your timeline. However, they will still be able to see whatever is public on your profile, including any activities you post with a “Public” privacy setting, and posts made by mutual friends to your timeline or comments that you post on the mutual friend’s timeline. They can also re-request you as a friend.  \n \nWhen you block a person, they will not be able to view your timeline activity, nor will they be able to message or tag you or send you another friend request. You will also not be able to see their activity. They will still be able to see your public information and activity within apps or groups. \n \nUse your judgment and instincts when considering the timing of these options. Since stalkers and abusers use monitoring and threats to maintain power and control over their victims, when a survivor limits access, abusers sometimes find other methods of control or escalate dangerous behavior, including increased threats and even assault. Ending a relationship or contact with an abusive person can be dangerous for many survivors so it is important to plan for safety and talk to a trained victim advocate. If you are concerned about what the person might do if you were to cut off contact, call your local domestic violence program or police for more information and help.", @"DVTechDetail18");
