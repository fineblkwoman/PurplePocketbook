If it looks like the abuser is about to hurt you, try to get to a safe place.  Stay out of the kitchen, garage, or workshop.  Try to avoid rooms with tile or hardwood floors.  \n \nIf the abuser does start to harm you, don't run to where the children are; the abuser may hurt them too.  \n \nIf there's no way to escape the violence at that moment, make yourself a small target.

Know your local battered women's shelter number.  \n \nLet friends and neighbors who you trust know what is going on in your home.  Make a plan with them so that they know when you need help and so they know what to do (such as calling the police or banging on your door).  Make up a signal with your neighbors, like flashing the lights on and off or hanging something out the window, which will alert them that you need help.  \n \nMake a habit of backing the car into the driveway (so you can quickly pull out) and having a full tank of gas.  Keep your car keys in the same place so you can easily grab them.  If you would be leaving by yourself (if you don’t have children), you might want to even keep the driver's door unlocked (and the other car doors locked) so that you are prepared to make a quick escape if you have to.  \n \nKeep a copy of important papers with you or in your car, such as your and your children’s birth certificates, passports, immigration papers, and Social Security cards, in case you have to leave in a hurry.  \n \nIf you can, call a domestic violence hotline from time to time to discuss your options and to talk to someone who understands you, even if you feel that you are not ready to leave.  One number you can call is the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE. \n \nThink of several reasons for leaving the house at different times of the day or night that the abuser will believe, in case you feel that the violence is about to erupt and you need an excuse to get out.", @"safeDetail4");

If the abuser finds it, you could be in more danger. Such evidence of physical abuse might include: \n \nPictures you have of bruises or other injuries. If possible, try to have these pictures dated; \n \nTorn or bloody clothing; \n \nHousehold objects that the abuser damaged or broke during a violent episode; \n \nPictures that show your home destroyed or messed up after violence happened; \n \nAny records you have from doctors or the police that document the abuse; \n \nWhenever you are hurt, go to a doctor or to an emergency room as soon as possible if you can.

If the abuser controls the household money, this might mean that you can only save a few dollars per week; the most important thing is that you save whatever amount you can that will not tip off the abuser and put you in further danger.  You can ask trusted friends or family members to hold money for you so that the abuser cannot find it and/or use it.  \n \nIf you are not employed, try to get job skills by taking classes at a community college or a vocational school if you can.  This will help you to get a job either before or after you leave so that you won't need to be financially dependent on the abuser.  \n \nGetting a protective order can be an important part of a safety plan when preparing to leave.  Even if you get a protective order, you should still take other safety planning steps to keep yourself and your children safe.  A legal protective order is not always enough to keep you safe.  Locate your state in our Know the Laws section to find out more information about getting a protective order. \n \nLeave when the abuser will least expect it.  This will give you more time to get away before the abuser realizes that you are gone. \n \nIf you have time to call the police before leaving, you can ask the police to escort you out of the house as you leave.
