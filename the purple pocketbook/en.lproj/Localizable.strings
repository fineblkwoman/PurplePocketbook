"Here's how you would go about getting a bond for good behavior: \n \nStep 1. Go to the magistrate court - criminal division in the county where the incident occurred. Tell the magistrate that you are interested in getting a bond for good behavior taken out on the abuser.  Be sure to bring any evidence or incident reports with you.  The magistrate will give you a pre-warrant application form. \n \nStep 2. Fill out the pre-warrant application form.  The magistrate may charge you a small fee for this application, but this fee can be waived in some situations.  You will have to swear that everything you have written is true and sign the forms in front of the magistrate or another court official. \n \nStep 3. The magistrate will take your application to the judge.  The judge will review the application.  The judge may want to ask you some questions. \n \nStep 4.  After reviewing your application, the judge will decide if there is enough evidence and information to have a hearing.  If there is not enough evidence, you will have to come back and start over if another incident occurs.  If there is enough evidence, the judge will set a hearing date and time, which will usually take place in 7 days. \n \nNote: If there is immediate danger to you or to your family, the judge may decide to issue an immediate absolute warrant and arrest the abuser immediately.  However, it is much more likely that the judge will just set a hearing date and time. \n \nStep 5. You must go to the hearing.  At the hearing, the judge will listen to you and to the abuser, and will look at all the evidence. Then the judge will make a decision.  There are three possible decisions: \n \nThe judge may decide that the evidence is so strong, and the situation so dangerous, that the abuser needs to be arrested.

(See next steps below.) \n \nThe judge may decide that there is not enough evidence to either issue a bond or to arrest the abuser.  In this case, the judge will just let the abuser leave, with no legal action taken. \n \nStep 6. If the judge decides to issue a bond for good behavior, then the abuser will be required to follow the orders set and written down by the judge for the duration of the bond. \n \nStep 7. The abuser will have to pay a certain amount of money to the court, or post bond in the form of property. The bond could be anywhere from a couple hundred dollars to several thousand dollars. \n \nStep 8. The bond for good behavior will last for up to 6 months, but can be renewed in 60 day increments.*  A judge has the discretion to extend it longer depending on the situation.  During the duration of the bond, the court will keep the money of the abuser.  If the abuser violates the judge's orders, or commits any crime against you, then the abuser will lose the money and can be arrested. \n \nStep 9. To renew a bond for good behavior, you must go back to the magistrate court -- criminal division and apply for a renewal. \n \nThe magistrate in the criminal division of your county will be able to help you with more specific information if you are interested in filing for a bond for good behavior or you can ask a lawyer for legal advice.

We strongly recommend that you talk to an attorney who specializes in custody matters to find out what you would have to prove to get the visits supervised and how long supervised visits would last, based on the facts of your case. \n \nIn the majority of cases, supervised visits are only a temporary measure. Although the exact visitation order will vary by state, county, or judge, the judge might order a professional to observe the other parent on a certain amount of visits or the visits might be supervised by a relative for a certain amount of time -- and if there are no obvious problems, the visits may likely become unsupervised. Oftentimes, at the end of a case, the other parent ends up with more frequent and/ or longer visits than s/he had before you went into court or even some form of custody. \n \nIn some cases, to protect your child from immediate danger by the abuser, starting a case to ask for custody and supervised visits is appropriate. To find out what may be best in your situation, please go to GA Finding a Lawyer to seek out legal advice.";

"The answer to this question is very complicated and may depend on many different factors.  The laws on parental kidnapping (also known as custodial interference) are different in each state.  In some states, it may be against the law to take children out of state only if it violates a custody order or if there is an active custody case pending.  In other states, the act of taking the children out of state itself may not be illegal unless the parent conceals (hides) the children from the other parent.  Other factors that may be considered are whether the parents are married (and considered to have equal parental rights) or, in the case of unmarried parents, whether the father's paternity has been legally established.  Also, there could be a big difference if the other parent is planning a brief visit out of state, a long absence, or if s/he is planning on moving out of state for a long time.  We strongly suggest talking to a lawyer who specializes in custody matters and/or a prosecutor to find out if the other parent's actions are legal or not." = "The answer to this question is very complicated and may depend on many different factors.

"The legal system is divided into two areas: civil law and criminal law. Separate courts govern (control) these two areas of the law.\n \nOne of the most confusing things about the legal system is the difference between civil cases and criminal cases. In domestic violence situations, there may be both civil and criminal cases occurring at the same time as a result of the same violent act. You may want to pursue both civil and criminal actions for maximum protection. The major differences have to do with who takes the case to court and the reason for the case. \n \nCivil Law \n \nIn a civil domestic violence action, you are asking the court to protect you from the person abusing you. You are not asking the court to send that person to jail for committing a crime. However, if the abuser violates the civil court order, he may be sent to jail for the violation. In a civil case, you are the person bringing the case against the abuser and (in most circumstances), you have the right to withdraw (drop) the case if you want to.  Protective orders in Georgia are handled in civil court. \n \nCriminal Law \n \nThe criminal law system handles all cases that involve violations of criminal law such as harassment, assault, murder, theft, etc. A criminal complaint involves your abuser being charged with a crime.  In a criminal case, the prosecutor (also called the district attorney) is the one who has control over whether the case against the abuser continues or not.
